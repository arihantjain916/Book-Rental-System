# Book Rental System

This project is a GraphQL API for a library management system. It is built using Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB. The project offers the following features:

- Admins can add books and authors.
- Users can rent books.
- If a user fails to return a book before the due date, a fine will be imposed. The fine increases by Rs. 10 for each day after the return date.
- The system keeps track of rented books and the fines owed.
- The system allows generating reports on the library's inventory and the fines owed.

The project is scalable and efficient, capable of managing libraries of any size.
The project ensures data security by storing information in a MongoDB database, which is both scalable and flexible.

The project was created to integrate with the [ERP portal](https://github.com/arihantjain916/ERP-Portal.git), where students can access the library. The project is available on GitHub.
